# C++ for Me

- (+) Fast product
- (+) Runs on many platforms
- (+) Robust debugging tool
- (-) Still have issues with pointers
- (-) Segfaults here and there

---

# When I Meet Rust

- System programming language
- Like C++, without segfaults (yum!)
- Better handling of reference and pointers
- Mixture of imperative and functional paradigm

---

# Why Rust?

- Easier to write secure code
- Easier to write multithreaded code (hello concurrency)
- Runs on many devices/platforms

---

# What to Do with Rust?

- System programming
- Something low-level enough to benefit from precise memory management
    - Web Browser (Mozilla Firefox)
    - Distributed storage system (Dropbox)
    - 3D Games
    - Device drive
    - Operating System
- General tool

---

# Rust Compared to Other

- Direct alternative to C++
- Lower level access to Go/Python
- Not just for network application like Node.js

---

# Rust's Killer Features

- Type safety
- Traits based generics
- Pattern matching
- Memory safety

---

#  How Rust is Fast and Safe?

- Extensive compiler checking
- Fast: No garbage collection, Rust automatically detect when to free memory
    + Ownership of data
- Safe: No data race, guaranteed data lifetime, no dangling-pointer
    + Ownership and Borrowing only allows one mutable reference (write access)

---

# Why Learn New Language?

- Gains new perspective on how things are done
- Gains new understanding on programming itself
- Make old and new things in a different way

# Tips for Learning Rust

- Katas: learn by making familiar things
- Try make small tool to replace your existing tool
- Consult the documentation
- Ask people on SO/Twitter
- Organize a community
